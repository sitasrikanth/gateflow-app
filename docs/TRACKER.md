| Hierarchical expense categories (main + sub) | ✅ | Firestore: `{name, icon, subCategories:[...]}` |

|------|--------|-------|
| Fix overflow in Pending Verification card | ✅ | Wrapped "Already paid — Additional payment" in `Flexible` |
| Compact flat selection grid (60+ flats) | ✅ | Replaced Wrap with floor-grouped grid in `add_contribution_screen.dart` |
| Rows per Floor setting in community settings | ✅ | 1/2/3 toggle next to "Set Floor Size" per block in `settings_screen.dart` |
| Apply rows-per-floor to Contributions tab | ✅ | `event_dashboard_screen.dart` `_buildFlatChips` uses sub-row logic |
| Apply rows-per-floor to Follow-up tab | ✅ | Same sub-row logic in follow-up `_buildFlatChips` |
| Live settings propagation via StreamBuilder | ✅ | All three views update instantly; no restart needed |
| Configurable payment modes in community settings | ✅ | `_PaymentModesCard` with drag-to-reorder, add, remove |

### ✅ WEEK 8 — Event Settings: Per-Type Config & Volunteer Roles
**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Dates:** 2026-06-28 (Session 6)  
**Theme:** Hierarchical admin settings for event types — Pooja Schedule, Special Contribution, Expense Categories, Volunteer Roles

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Event Settings screen (`event_type_settings_screen.dart`) | ✅ | Tune icon in admin Events tab opens settings |
| Pooja Schedule — enable per event type + slot capacity | ✅ | Category → event type collapse; morning/evening stepper |
| Special Contribution — enable per event type + preset chips + default note | ✅ | `_SpecialContributionSection`, per-type config |
| Expense Categories — per-event-type editor (hierarchical) | ✅ | Auto-seeds from `event_types.dart` defaults on first expand |
| Fix: category count badge always visible (not just after seeding) | ✅ | Shows default count before Firestore is written |
| Replace generic default categories (remove Annadam/Ganesh Idol etc.) | ✅ | Now: Food & Catering, Venue & Setup, Entertainment, Photography, Gifts & Prizes |
| Volunteer Roles — per-event-type roles editor | ✅ | `_VolunteerRolesSection`; add/rename/delete chips |
| Dashboard Volunteer tab loads roles from Firestore | ✅ | `_VolunteersTabState._loadRoles()` reads `/eventTypeConfig/{typeId}` |
| Wire `eventTypeId` to `_ContributionsTab` and `_VolunteersTab` | ✅ | Passed from main `build` → `data['eventTypeId']` |
| `AddContributionScreen` loads default note + preset descriptions | ✅ | Three nested StreamBuilders (specialContribution, eventTypeConfig, community_settings) |
| Firestore: `/appSettings/poojaSchedule`, `/appSettings/specialContribution`, `/eventTypeConfig/{typeId}` | ✅ | Paths live, rules open |

**Success Criteria:**
- [x] Admin can enable Pooja Schedule for specific event types only
- [x] Special Contribution chips and default note configurable per event type
- [x] Expense categories differ per event type (Ganesh vs Sports vs Kids)
- [x] Volunteer roles differ per event type and can be customised

**Blockers:** None  
**Notes:** Volunteer Roles stored under `volunteerRoles: [String]` in `/eventTypeConfig/{typeId}`. Dashboard loads roles once in `initState` (not real-time stream) — acceptable since roles rarely change mid-event.

## CONTRIBUTION & DONATIONS ROADMAP

Feature set for events like Ganesh Chaturthi, Navratri, Independence Day. Audited existing code on 2026-07-04 against a 9-item wishlist; two were already built. Build order below is MVP-first (low effort / high value first, and items that other items depend on go before their dependents).

| # | Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Custom Contribution | ✅ Built | Admin ("Record Contribution") and resident ("Report Payment") both accept any free-form amount. |
| 2 | Multiple Payment Methods | ✅ Built | Cash, UPI, PhonePe, Google Pay, Bank Transfer, NEFT/RTGS, Cheque, Other — configurable in Admin Settings. |
| 3 | Suggested Contribution | ✅ Built (2026-07-04) | Quick-amount chips (₹500/₹1000/₹2000/₹5000) added beside the amount field in both Record Contribution and Report Payment. |
| 4 | Anonymous Donation | ✅ Built (2026-07-04) | Toggle in both flows; `isAnonymous` stored on the doc, flat/name kept for admin accounting, name hidden + "ANONYMOUS" badge shown in admin's Contributions tab and pending-verification queue. |
| 5 | Contribution History | ✅ Built (2026-07-04) | New "My Contribution History" screen (receipt icon in My Events AppBar) — cross-event list with total-paid summary card. Queries each event's contributions subcollection per-flat rather than a Firestore collectionGroup query, to avoid requiring a manually-created composite index. |
| 6 | Download Receipt | ✅ Built (2026-07-04) | Per-contribution A5 PDF receipt (`exportContributionReceipt` in `event_pdf_report.dart`), downloadable from resident's Contribution History and admin's Contributions tab. Only offered for confirmed (non-pending) contributions. |
| 7 | Pay Remaining Balance | ✅ Built (2026-07-04) | New optional `expectedAmountPerFlat` field on event create/edit. Remaining-balance banner + "Pay Remaining" quick-chip in both Report Payment and Record Contribution. No "at a glance" indicator on the event card yet (only shown when opening the contribute flow) — noted as a possible future polish item. |
| 8 | Leaderboard | ✅ Built (2026-07-04) | Configurable per event type (new Leaderboard section in Event Settings, opt-in like Collection Status by Block). Overview tab shows "Top Contributors" ranked by flat total; anonymous contributions are summed separately as an unranked footnote, never shown with a flat number. |
| 9 | Sponsor Packages | ✅ Built (2026-07-04) | Configurable per event type (new section in Event Settings). Admins define tiers per event via Event Tools → Manage Sponsor Packages (`sponsor_packages_screen.dart`, stored as `events/{id}.sponsorPackages`). New "Sponsorship" contribution type with tier picker in Record Contribution. Public "Our Sponsors" wall in Overview tab, respecting the Anonymous toggle. |

## SESSION 8 — EVENT MANAGEMENT ENHANCEMENTS (2026-07-04)

Follow-on polish pass after the Contribution & Donations roadmap shipped, plus a new Task Management module.

| # | Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Delete rejected contributions from Activity tab | ✅ Built | Admin can permanently remove rejected entries instead of only restoring them. |
| 2 | Status filter in Activity tab | ✅ Built | Filter chips for pending/approved/rejected/deleted alongside existing wing/block/date filters. |
| 3 | Block tap → Contributions tab | ✅ Built | Tapping a block in Block Stats jumps to the Contributions tab pre-filtered to that block. |
| 4 | Contribute Now vs Contribute More button colors | ✅ Built | Green vs blue for clearer visual distinction (previously green vs teal, too similar). |
| 5 | Resident "My Contribution" stat + detail sheet | ✅ Built | New Overview stat chip showing the logged-in resident's own total, with a tap-through detail/edit/delete sheet. |
| 6 | Rejection notification banner | ✅ Built | Prominent in-app red banner shown to a resident when their contribution is rejected (no backend push infra yet, so in-app only). |
| 7 | Admin Special vs Regular contribution breakdown | ✅ Built | New Overview widget totals Regular vs Special separately and lists each special entry by flat. Excludes External Donations (own category). |
| 8 | Reopen a closed event | ✅ Built | Event Tools menu shows "Reopen Event" when status is closed, "Close Event" when active. |
| 9 | Cascade-delete fix — `schedule` subcollection | ✅ Fixed | Event deletion was missing the Pooja Schedule slot-booking subcollection, leaving orphaned data. Added to the cascade-delete list. |
| 10 | Configurable Overview Stats chips | ✅ Built | New "Overview Stats" section in Event Settings — admin chooses which of Cash / Online / Collected / Spent / Expected / Balance / Anonymous / External chips show per event type. Defaults to all shown. |
| 11 | Admin-always-visible Leaderboard | ✅ Built | Admin now always sees "Top Contributors" on the Overview tab regardless of the per-event-type Leaderboard setting, for oversight. Residents still gated by the setting. |
| 12 | External Donations | ✅ Built | New "External Donation" contribution type for non-resident sources (broadband company, builders, store operators). No wing/block/flat — donor/organization name instead. Admin-only entry (reuses the existing admin-only Record Contribution screen). New admin-only "External Donations" viewer card + configurable "External" Overview chip beside Anonymous. |
| 13 | My Events header reposition | ✅ Built | Resident's "My Events" header now shows the resident name/flat info line above the "My Events" title (previously below), both moved up for better spacing above the tab bar. |

## TASK MANAGEMENT MODULE (2026-07-04)

New admin-only "Tasks" tab per event, scoped to that event's approved volunteers (per-event, not a community-wide board — decided since volunteers are only registered per-event). Volunteers have no separate login (they're residents), so a lightweight "My Tasks" view was added inside the resident-facing Volunteers tab instead of a second tab.

| # | Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Create Tasks | ✅ Built | `TaskFormScreen` (`task_form_screen.dart`) — title, description, due date. |
| 2 | Assign Owners | ✅ Built | Multi-select picker restricted to that event's `status: approved` volunteers only. |
| 3 | Due Dates | ✅ Built | Date picker; overdue tasks (past due, not Done) flagged red in cards and detail view. |
| 4 | Progress Tracking | ✅ Built | Admin birds-eye view: stat chips (Total/Pending/In Progress/Done) + overdue banner + status filter chips. |
| 5 | Checklist | ✅ Built | Add/remove text items in the form; checkboxes toggled live by admin or assigned volunteer in the detail sheet. |
| 6 | Dependencies | ✅ Built | Tasks can depend on other tasks in the same event; detail view shows each dependency's live title + status. No cycle-detection (simple community-app scope), just self-reference is excluded. |
| 7 | Comments | ✅ Built | `tasks/{taskId}/comments` subcollection; both admin and assigned volunteers can post; shows author name + admin/resident badge. |
| 8 | Attach Photos | ✅ Built | Camera or gallery via `image_picker`, uploaded to Firebase Storage at `tasks/{eventId}/{taskId}/...`, shown as a thumbnail strip with delete. |
| 9 | Status (Pending/In Progress/Done) | ✅ Built | Editable by admin or the assigned volunteer from the shared detail sheet; drives the birds-eye stat counts. |

**All 9 items shipped as of 2026-07-04.**

## KEY DECISIONS LOG

| Date | Decision | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-05-30 | Flutter + Firebase chosen | Best AI support, offline-first, free tier |
| 2026-05-30 | Android Phase 1 only | Faster launch, validate before iOS investment |
| 2026-05-30 | Society subscription pricing | Predictable MRR, single decision-maker |
| 2026-06-13 | Guard login via 6-digit quick code (no OTP) | Guards don't have smartphones always; simpler UX |
| 2026-06-13 | Guard session in SharedPreferences (no Firebase Auth) | Guards need fast login without phone verification |
| 2026-06-13 | Hybrid RBAC — roles for routing, permissions array for admin UI | Flexible without complex Firebase rules |
| 2026-06-13 | Resident status = 'pending' until admin approves | Security — prevents unauthorized access |
| 2026-06-14 | Visitor notification via Firestore StreamBuilder (not FCM) | Works in-app instantly; FCM added later for background |
| 2026-06-14 | Visitor status flow: pending → approved/denied | Guard logs, resident decides, guard sees result |
| 2026-06-14 | Hierarchical expense categories (`{name, icon, subCategories:[]}`) | Flat list insufficient for community events (Annadam has rice/veg/plates sub-items) |
| 2026-06-14 | Dialog-based add forms instead of inline forms in settings | Inline forms too space-heavy in collapsed card UI |
| 2026-06-14 | `TextEditingController.dispose()` deferred via `addPostFrameCallback` in all dialogs | Synchronous dispose triggers `editable_text.dart` assertion during dismiss animation |
| 2026-06-14 | Extract `StatelessWidget` subclasses when `ExpansionTile` tree gets complex | Monolithic build methods cause `PageStorageKey` state and gesture detection bugs |
| 2026-06-14 | Contributions grouped Wing → Block, not flat list | Makes it easy to spot missing flats per block; pending count visible at block level |
| 2026-06-27 | Flat grid rows stored per-block as `flatGridRows.${wing}_${block}` map in Firestore | Different blocks have different floor sizes; global setting would be wrong |
| 2026-06-27 | Read-merge-write pattern for `flatGridRows` updates (not `set` with merge) | Shallow merge in `set` replaces whole sub-map; read-merge-write preserves all blocks |
| 2026-06-27 | Grocery-style tab bar for admin only; classic bar for residents | Admin has 5 tabs needing more horizontal space; resident has only 2 tabs and simple use case |
| 2026-06-27 | Payment modes configurable in community settings (not hardcoded) | Admin wanted PhonePe/Google Pay by default but needed flexibility for future |
| 2026-06-28 | Per-event-type config stored in `/eventTypeConfig/{typeId}` (separate from `/appSettings`) | App-level settings (which types support pooja) live in `/appSettings`; per-type details (categories, roles, special note) live in `/eventTypeConfig` — keeps documents small |
| 2026-06-28 | Volunteer roles loaded once in `initState` (not StreamBuilder) | Roles don't change mid-event; one fetch is cheaper and simpler than a live stream on every tab |
| 2026-06-28 | Expense category count badge shows default count before seeding | UX fix — badge was hidden until admin expanded the event type once, which felt broken |
| 2026-06-28 | `kDefaultCategories` replaced with generic names (removed Annadam, Ganesh Idol) | Fallback defaults apply to any event type; event-type-specific defaults come from `event_types.dart` |
| 2026-07-04 | Anonymous Donation moved up to #4 in Contribution & Donations roadmap (ahead of Contribution History/Receipt) | Deciding the anonymous-entry data shape early avoids reworking Leaderboard ranking and history display later |
| 2026-07-04 | Sponsor Packages placed last in Contribution & Donations roadmap | Highest complexity (tiers, perks, admin config) and least essential for a resident-run festival fund vs. a corporate-sponsored event |
| 2026-07-04 | Admin always sees the Leaderboard; residents remain gated by the per-event-type setting | Admin needs contribution rankings for oversight even on event types where the public leaderboard is intentionally turned off |
| 2026-07-04 | External Donations reuse the existing `contributions` subcollection (empty wing/block/flat) instead of a new collection | Downstream aggregations (Leaderboard, Block Stats) already skip empty-flat entries gracefully; avoids a parallel data model for a small feature |
| 2026-07-04 | External Donations counted into Collected/Cash-Online totals, same as Anonymous | Money still gets deposited into the event fund; it's a labeling/reporting distinction, not a separate ledger |
| 2026-07-04 | Task Management scoped per-event, assignable only to that event's approved volunteers | Volunteers register per-event (no community-wide volunteer pool); a global task board would let tasks be assigned to people not actually signed up for that event |
| 2026-07-04 | Resident "My Tasks" view embedded in the existing Volunteers tab instead of a new resident-facing tab | Volunteers only have a resident login (no separate account); admin explicitly asked for the Tasks tab itself to stay admin-only |
| 2026-07-04 | Task checklist and dependencies stored as embedded arrays on the task doc; comments as a subcollection | Checklist/dependency lists are small and bounded (whole-array rewrite is cheap); comments grow unbounded over an event's lifetime and benefit from their own live stream, consistent with how contributions/expenses/volunteers are already modeled as subcollections |
| 2026-07-04 | Overview Stats chips configurable per event type via `eventTypeConfig/{typeId}.overviewChips` | Different event types care about different numbers (e.g. a small pooja may not need a Sponsor/External chip); unset = all shown, so existing events aren't affected by default |
